    <h5><b>Ambedkar Political Career</b></h5>
    <p>In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two years.

At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism.[59] He would repeathis message at many public meetings across India.</p>
