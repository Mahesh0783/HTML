<!-- Pre-formatted Text in HTML -->


<!-- As we have discussed, paragraphs cannot preserve extra lines and space. If we need to create content that uses multiple
spaces and lines, we can use the HTML
<pre> tag.

The <pre> tag creates preformatted text. Preformatted texts are displayed as written in the HTML file. For example -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Other Elements Inside Paragraphs -->

        <!-- It's possible to include one HTML element inside another. This is also true for <p> tags.         for example: <strong> -->
        <h1><strong>Pre-formatted Text in HTML</strong></h1>
        <pre>
          This text  
            will be 
              displayed
              
              in the same manner 
                as it is written
        </pre>
        
    </body>
    </html>
